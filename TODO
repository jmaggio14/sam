need to add logging functionality (particularly to ease autodebugging)
color logging (if possible)
add error checking to all methods
finish adding astronomical constants to Constants.py (there should be absolutely no hardcoded values in methods)
test logging level modification
check signs in stellar_structure.pressure_by_radius
make Constants more consistent
