need to add logging functionality (particularly to ease autodebugging)
color logging (if possible)
add error checking to all methods
finish adding astronomical constants to Constants.py (there should be absolutely no hardcoded values in methods)
test logging level modification
check signs in stellar_structure.pressure_by_radius
make Constants more consistent
modify value_check '>','<','=' to support numpy arrays
reorganize method/file structure (for instance put everything related to blackbodies in one file
finish Star class
add array_check() method to Debug.py

how to determine pressure changes in star?
how to find internal mass given radius 'r'

Reorganize file system --> somewhat confusing. Stellar Structure vs other systems?

ADD units to the constants file! How have you not done this yet?
