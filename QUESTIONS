-How to generate opacity data sets (@me genuninely cannot figure out the website)? Easy way to read in OPAL data (.csv?) or should I write my own interpreter?

-I'm stuck calculating internal density of a star. Is that a paramater I can derive from the mass gradient or some other equation? or should I just use a simple average like we generally use in class? 
	'--> In other words should I use mass/volume or rho(r)? (@me probably the latter)

-I have been unable to find any equations to determine the radius of the star based off it's mass and composition. 
	'--> I could approximate it by regressing a set stars which have these values empirically measured and build a look-up-table for my star, but that seems like an fairly archaic solution and that wouldn't effectively take into account X, Y & Z. Something I'm missing?
	'--> I found one equation which states R ~ M^0.8?
