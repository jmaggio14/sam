color logging (if possible)
add error checking to all methods

check signs in stellar_structure.pressure_by_radius
reorganize method/file structure (for instance put everything related to blackbodies in one file
finish Star class
add array_check() method to Debug.py



what is Xcno?
integration of internal mass
redocument new stellar_structure equations
